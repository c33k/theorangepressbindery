## About Us
Hello! My name is Rafael and I'm a Brazilian bookbinder located in Poland. *The Orange Press Bindery* is my corner dedicated to the art and craft of bookbinding. Here you can find details about my latest bindings and also about the notebooks I create.

I've been binding books since 2022. My main focus is on fine bindings (ie. bindings with leather). I do re-bindings of books and I am currently creating my first line of notebooks.

All the books and notebooks you will see here are handmade by me in my small office.
