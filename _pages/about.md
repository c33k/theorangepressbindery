## About Us
(under construction)

Hello! My name is Rafael. I'm a Brazilian bookbinder located in Poland. The Orange Press Bindery is my website and social media dedicated to the art and craft of bookbinding. Here you can find details about my latest bindings and also about the notebooks I create.

I've been binding books for three years now. My main focus is on fine bindings (ie. bindings with leather). I do rebindings of books and I am currently creating my line of notebook.

Please check my Instagram to get the latest news on my work.
